# What is this?

**As a web developer**, I juggle many URLs but they are all variants of the same URL that belongs to my company. EG:
* www.starblux.com
* staging.starblux.com
* localdev.starblux.com:5000
* www.starblux.com?query_key=query_value

**I want** a tool that can quickly edit, output, and organize such URLs.
